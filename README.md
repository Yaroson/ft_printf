# FT_PRINTF

Everybody knows printf, the function we first encounter when we are introduced to programming and try to display "Hello World!", whatever language you use.

This project consists in recoding a better, more stable version of the famous printf function which will handle "cspdiuxX" conversions and "0-[1st*][width].[2nd*][precision]" flags.
